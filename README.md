## Acknowledgments
Special thanks to Springhill Suites, which is where I did most of the work for this homework.  The room was gross and noisy, the workkspace adequate and the carpet was so gross I had to put my shoes on to use the rest room.  I was able to get extra towels, though.  It's good to be alive.
