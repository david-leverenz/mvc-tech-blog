## Attention Grader
This site is much better than the last submission.  Everything works EXCEPT:
1. There is no post comment functionality.  The backend route is solid, just not implemented on the front end.
2. There is no delete blog or comment functionality.  The backend routes are solid, just not implemented on the front end.
