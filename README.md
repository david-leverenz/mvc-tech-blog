## Attention Grader
This project is not 100% complete.  It has a lot of working functionality but it is not all tied together.  The Heroku link will not work until I fix a few things.  I ran out of time because I was working on Project Two.  Below is a list of functional and non-functional items to help in your assessment.  Please have mercy on me :).  I really tried and will continue to work on this.<br>
### Functional
1) Database models are correctly assembled and linked.
2) Seed files and script are correctly created and functional.
3) All backend routes are correctly written and functional.  They all work in Insomnia.  This includes:<br>
   a. Logout<br>
   b. Login<br>
   c. Sign Up<br>
   d. Post Comment<br>
   e. Delete Comment<br>
   f. Post Blog<br>
   g. Get All Blogs<br>
   h. Get One Blog<br>
   i. Delete Blog<br>
4) Server.js and connection.js are properly written.
5) All blogs and single blog display properly in Insomnia.
6) Handlebars files are setup up and have a professional, modern, polished look.
7) Main page looks good and has a login button and dashboard link.

### In Progress
1. Essentially, I am missing the javascript to tie everything together.
2. I am struggling with getting things tied to my routes, like login.  I may have to wait until my next tutoring session.
3. While I have good looking Handlebars files (change extension to .html to view them), I am having trouble getting them called from routes.
4. User Profile route doesn't work for some reason.  It won't work in Insomnia and everything looks correct.  I'll need professional help to get this figured out.
5. Heroku link does not work and I'll need my instructor's help to figure it out.
